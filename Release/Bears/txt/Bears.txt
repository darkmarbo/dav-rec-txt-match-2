Bears 

by Sarah Courtauld 

When you hear this sound, turn the page.

A big brown bear is walking in a forest.

She stands up.
She climbs a tree, using her long sharp claws.
Then she sniffs out juicy berries to eat.

Bears have thick heavy coats and big, furry paws. Some bears go to rivers, to catch fish. 

Panda bears live high up on cold mountains. They munch on tough grass called bamboo. 

Polar bears live in the icy Arctic.
Their thick, hairy coats keep them warm.

Each year, bears find a partner. Then the female bear digs a den.

She gives birth to baby bears inside the warm, snug den. They are called cubs, and they are as small as apples. At first, they can't see or hear.

The cubs cuddle up close to their mother. She feeds them with her milk. Now it is winter. They all stay curled up inside the den.

At last, it's spring. 
They climb out into the sun.
The cubs start to play.

They climb trees. They fight. They lick each other's noses. This shows they are friends.

Their mother is close. She keeps them safe.
